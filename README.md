Beginner's Language Game
========================
This game originated as my second year project in A2 Computing. We had to create a program for a client, so I built a Flash and ActionScript language game for a student studying Spanish at Chester University. The idea of the game was to build a cursory understanding of a variety of languages (nine) with interactability and reasonable accuracy. The client was pleased with the result and commented on its colorful aesthetic and fluid design.


The Issues
---------------
No outstanding errors or bugs, so the program ran smoothly without any software issues. However, my method of translation was crude at best. Some of the words remained untranslated, and had "translations" that were the exact same word. Practically, this was an issue. However, the client had expressed complete acceptance of this fault, claiming that they had wanted only a basic understanding of the languages, and that the variety of such outweighed the occasional mistake.


Why Refurbish?
---------------
This game was a project that I spent a lot of time on. Besides my sentiment for it being the first program I successfuly developed and programmed, I believe it can be a good example of both my enthusiasm for software development and my ability to get something completed, however small. Additionally, having written it in ActionScript 3.0 it demonstrates my understanding of scripting languages and other Object Oriented languages that aren't Java or C++.

The Goal
---------------
I want to be able to present this program without the urge to justify the hasty coding with things like, "I was just starting out." or "This was my first program." I want the game to be able to stand on its own as an up-to-date example of what I can do.

This includes replacing the hard-coded linked lists of words, as well as other poorly structured code examples.
